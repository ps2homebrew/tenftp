tenftp is a filesystem driver for the IOP processor.

it tries to allow you to use 
ftp:// in file commands like fioOpen


usage:

ftp://user:pass@ip:port/
gives you root listing

ftp://user:pass@ip:port/path/
gives you a listing of /path/

ftp://user:pass@ip:port/path/file.ext
opens file.ext



currently dOpen wont work, use the listing path instead
<-i'm working on this

if you dont specify //user:pass@ip:port/
the last server will be used

you can have up to 8 ftp files open at the same time

if you want to switch from one server to another
( you had 
ftp://user:pass@ip:port/path/fil.ext
open. closed it and now want to open 
ftp://user:pass@ip2:port/path/fil.ext
)
then you need to wait 30 seconds 
for the server connection to time out, 
if you already have 7 other connections active

( if you have less than 7 active connections 
  or are opening a file from a server 
  you already read files from,
  then it's no problem )
